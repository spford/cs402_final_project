Hey, so I have most of the features working. I need help with a couple of things. The UI isn't spaced right and needs to be reworked. Right now the titles are where my camera is. 
And I need help setting up a server to hold all of the Items. We can probably just package them up as JSON Objects and send them to the links provided.
